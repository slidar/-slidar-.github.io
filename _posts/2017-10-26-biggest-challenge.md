title: Biggest challenge learning to develop
---
Everyone tells you that you need to be very focused and never give up if your going into development. It doesn't sound too scary when you hear those words but when you get into certain situations. Those are the scary moments where you cant give up. I've been learning that there are so many resources you have and help that is there for you when you ask for it. Sitting down for hours stuck on the same problem is the hardest thing I have faced. It was really hard not quitting but I learned to keep trying different solutions and asking a lot of questions. Asking questions and figuring out where to look for solutions is key for me to becoming a better developer.
