title: Goals as a Frontend developer
---

Back in middle school I always thought how cool it was to work on computers and find out whats wrong with them or how to make them run faster without any problems. Now I am learning how to write and build websites that run smooth and look amazing that are user friendly. I hope to work at UPS as a web developer. They are always creating new things and brainstorming new idea. That is where I want to start my career as web developer.
