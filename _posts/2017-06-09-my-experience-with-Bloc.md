title: My Experience at Bloc
--

Going to Bloc has been so exciting and adventures experience. I really enjoy how many resources they provide for you. They know how much information to give without giving you the straight answer. One of the most useful things I use is my mentor and I have so many different ways I can reach them. Bloc shows me how to properly code and see which way works best in certain situations. They hand you great help and make me feel work hard but also don't have you do the impossible.
